// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Ask for 2 integers (j), (i)
 Do not proceed unless 2 integers are received
 Make note of integers received by user (j&&i)
   Perform (j+i)
    Display answer to (j+i) for user

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for an integer (j)
 Do not proceed unless an integer is received
 Make note of integer received by user (j)
  Perform (j/2)
   If j/2
    Display "This number is even"
   Else 
    Display "This number is odd"
    
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ask for 5 integers (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)
 Do not proceed unless 5 integers are received
 Make note of integers received by user (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) 
  List numbers on separate lines 
 Perform (a+b+c+d+e)
  Take answer (l) to (a+b+c+d+e) and perform (l/5)
   Make note of the answer (f) to (l/5)
 Perform (i>j) for each integer on a line with every other integer in the list
  Move down a line
 Loop command (i>j) until command used on every line then stop
  Make note of the largest number (t) and smallest (s) from (i>j)
 Display "The average number of this list is (f)"
 Then display "The maximum number of this list is (t) and smallest is (s)"
